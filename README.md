## ✅ Purpose

This collection is designed to simplify development and testing against the Blackboard Learn APIs using Postman. It supports common tasks including authentication, course and user operations, and API chaining with environment variables.

---

## 🛠️ Pre-requisites

Before using this collection, define the following **Global Variables** in Postman:

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `baseUrl` | Your Blackboard Learn instance base URL (for example, `https://yourinstitution.learn.blackboard.com`) |
| `basicAuthUsername` | Your **Application Key** (Client ID), created in Anthology's [Developer Portal](https://developer.anthology.com/) following the instructions on [Basic Authentication with REST](https://docs.anthology.com/docs/blackboard/rest-apis/getting-started/basic-authentication) |
| `basicAuthPassword` | Your **Application Secret** (Client Secret), paired with the Application Key |

These credentials are used to authenticate via Basic Auth and retrieve an OAuth 2.0 token.

---

## 🔐 Authentication Workflow

1. Send a `POST` request to:

   ```bash
   {{baseUrl}}/learn/api/public/v1/oauth2/token
   ```

2. Your `basicAuthUsername` and `basicAuthPassword` are sent via Basic Auth.

3. The response returns an `access_token`, which is saved in the `apiKey` environment variable.

4. This token is automatically used for future requests by setting the header:

   ```bash
   Authorization: Bearer {{apiKey}}
   ```

> ⚠️ Be sure to retrieve an access token before calling any other endpoints.

---

## 🚀 Using the Collection

- Endpoints are grouped by category (for example, Users, Courses, Enrolments).
- Some requests require specific parameters such as `userId` or `courseId`.
- Postman scripts are included to handle token storage and variable assignment.
- Supports chaining requests and managing dynamic workflows with variables and pre-request scripts.
